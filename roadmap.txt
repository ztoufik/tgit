1. tgit: version control system with multiple backend supported (including sqlite database)
2. functionalities:
    1. tgit add for file staging
    2. tgit commit for commiting
    3. tgit hash-object for hashing blob content (files,dirs,commits)
    4. tgit cat-file for displaying blob content based on hash-id
    5. tgit diff,log, for diffing commits & logging commit history
    6. tgit checkout  for branchs & refs
    7. tgit merge for merging commits & branchs
    6. (optional) tgit push & pull for remote repos (if possible from github)
3.Design:
    - tgit functionalities implemented as library modules 
    - separate cli module for interacting with user commands
    - data layer object dependency injected (startegy pattern) in the cli module
3. Roadmap:
    1.design the type system for blob, tree, commit, refs
    2.API Data layer object specification
    3.implement hash-object & cat-file for object database manipulation
    4.implement the data layer object for sqlite database engine
